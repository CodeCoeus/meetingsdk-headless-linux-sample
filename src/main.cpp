explain this code line by line, and explain what functions and classes are doing here
This code seems to be part of a program using the Zoom SDK to automate Zoom functionalities, probably a Zoom Meeting Bot. Let's go through it line by line:

Includes and Using Directives:

#include <csignal>       // For signal handling functions such as std::signal
#include <glib.h>        // For the GLib library, particularly for its event loop
#include "Config.h"      // Custom header, presumably for application configuration
#include "Zoom.h"        // Custom header, possibly for interfacing with the Zoom SDK
onExit Callback:

void onExit() {
    auto* zoom = &Zoom::getInstance();  // Accesses the singleton instance of the Zoom class
    zoom->leave();                      // Tells the Zoom instance to leave any ongoing meeting
    zoom->clean();                      // Cleans up resources used by the Zoom instance

    cout << "exiting..." << endl;       // Outputs a message to the standard output indicating that the program is exiting
}
This function is a cleanup routine that will be called when the program exits normally.

onSignal Callback:

void onSignal(int signal) {
    onExit();                     // Calls the onExit function
    _Exit(signal);                // Exits the process with a signal code (forces exit without cleanup)
}
This function is a signal handler that will be called when the process receives a termination signal like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM.

onTimeout Callback:

gboolean onTimeout (gpointer data) {
    return TRUE;  // Informs GLib that the timeout callback should be called again
}
This function serves as a callback for the GLib event loop, returning 
TRUE
 ensures the callback will be repeatedly called.

run Function:

SDKError run(int argc, char** argv) {
    [...]
}
This function contains the main logic to set up the Zoom instance:

It registers signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM using 
signal()
.
Sets up a callback to be executed at exit with 
atexit()
.
It reads command-line arguments and possibly a config file to configure the Zoom instance.
Initializes the Zoom SDK.
Authorizes the application to use the Zoom SDK.
main Function:

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    [...]
}
This is the entry point of the program:

Runs the 
run
 function to start and configure the Zoom bot, passing the command-line arguments.
Checks for any errors occurred during initialization or configuration.
Sets up a GLib event loop by creating a 
GMainLoop
 object.
Adds a timeout callback to the event loop using 
g_timeout_add()
.
Starts the event loop using 
g_main_loop_run()
, which will block and process events until 
g_main_loop_quit()
 is called.
Based on this code snippet:

Zoom
 class likely handles the interaction with the Zoom SDK.
Config.h
 might contain definitions related to application configuration.
The application is designed to respond to POSIX signals and perform cleanup.
It is using GLib to handle event-driven features inside an event loop.
SDKError
 might be a custom type or part of the Zoom SDK for error handling. It seems to be used to communicate the success or failure of SDK operations.
The convention of the functions like 
leave
, 
clean
, 
config
, 
init
, and 
auth
 isn't shown, but they probably perform the actions their names describe.
Finally, this code includes logging "exitingâ€¦" to the console when the 
onExit
 function is called, which is a good practice for understanding the program's lifecycle.
